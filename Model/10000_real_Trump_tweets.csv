4141,Barack Obama has everything to gain . Why would anyone ever deny $ 5M to charity ?,1
4142,"If my offer is refused , every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $ 5M to charity all because he is hiding something !",1
4143,"If Obama does n't accept my offer to be fully transparent , what will he say ?",1

4147,Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was “ professionally dead. ” I saved her tiny ...,1
4148,The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone .,1
4149,I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President .,1
4150,"I put @ DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request , I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement .",1
4151,"@ DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star . But , he just does n't have what it takes ... and he never will .",1
4152,Alert ... The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi . He did nothing ... he is no leader .,1
4153,@ Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly ... you 're terrific !,1
4154,@ BernardMcGuirk . That 's more than O'Reilly did ... and he is supposed to be my friend . You 're terrific !,1

4162,Now grotesque @ BetteMidler is into the Trump act -- - trying to become relevant again .,1
4163,I never liked @ BetteMidler 's persona or singing and have n't heard her name in years .,1
4164,"But whenever she sees me , she kisses my ass . She 's disgusting . @ BetteMidler",1
4165,. @ BetteMidler talks about my hair but I 'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body -- - so I wo n't . Is this a double standard ?,1
4166,"While @ BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman , I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct .",1
4167,"I guess @ BillMaher saw my ratings on the @ Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno . Bill , you are no Letterman .",1
4168,". @ BillMaher , who got thrown off ABC for being stupid , is always so nice to me to my face and constantly asking ( cont )",1
4169,What people do n't know about @ BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early ( cont ),1
4170,I 'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $ 5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go .,1
4171,Dave Letterman @ Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was `` probably '' born in the US -- the word `` probably '' is a disaster for Obama .,1
4172,Obama lied 100 % about Libya and the killings -- emails are absolute . He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies .,1
4173,I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country . The storm could be very good for him as he ( cont ),1
4174,Many people walked out on Madonna 's concert when she told them to vote for Obama . Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible !,1

4176,We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium -- they are seeking refuge . Free coffee and food .,1
4177,"Direct view of crane from apartment window . Crane was never properly secured , blowing in the breeze .",1
4178,"If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower , call office .",1
4179,"All weights are on crane 's wrong side -- - very precarious below , move out !",1
4180,The water damage to NYC is amazing . The winds were bad but the water was worse .,1
4181,I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm .,1
4182,Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars .,1
4183,"Not only giving out money , but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President -- - do n't fall for it .",1

4192,So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help -- - I say thanks to you !,1
4193,The election is trending towards @ MittRomney . Americans know we ca n't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline .,1

4203,@ digiphile @ RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $ 5M for charity -- for Red Cross or another great charity,1
4204,Why does Obama believe he should n't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition ? Hiding something ?,1
4205,People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out .,1
4206,Scary . Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $ 5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years . 4 more years ?,1
4207,Maybe Obama should donate my $ 5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm ?,1
4208,China ’ s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses Their market gains the day we are hit by storm,1
4209,Fans should n't worry . We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @ CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm .,1
